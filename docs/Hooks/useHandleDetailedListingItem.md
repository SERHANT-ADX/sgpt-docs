The `useHandleDetailedListingItem` custom hook is designed for managing the active detailed listing item in a React application. It takes a `listingId` as input and uses the `useGetDetailedListing` hook to fetch detailed listing data. It also considers the list of all listings, the list of favorite listing IDs, and a function to set the active listing.

### Usage
```jsx static
import useHandleDetailedListingItem from './useHandleDetailedListingItem';

// Inside a functional component
useHandleDetailedListingItem({
  listingId,
  allListings,
  favoriteListingsIds,
  setActiveListing,
});
```

### Parameters
- `listingId` (String): A string representing the unique identifier of the listing you want to handle as the active detailed listing.
- `allListings` (Array): An array representing all available listings.
- `favoriteListingsIds` (Array): An array of strings containing the unique identifiers of favorite listings.
- `setActiveListing` (Function): A function used to set the active detailed listing.

### Functionality
1. **Importing Dependencies**: The hook starts by importing necessary dependencies like `useEffect` for side effects and the `useGetDetailedListing` hook for fetching detailed listing data.

2. **Using `useGetDetailedListing`**: The `useGetDetailedListing` hook is used to fetch detailed listing data for the specified `listingId`. It retrieves the `detailedListingData` object.

3. **Handling Active Listing**: Inside the `useEffect` hook, the logic for handling the active detailed listing is implemented.

    - It first checks if a valid `listingId` exists. If not, it sets the active listing to `null` and returns, effectively clearing the active listing.

    - It attempts to find the listing with the given `listingId` from the `allListings` array. If it can't find the listing or if there is no detailed listing data available, it sets the active listing to `null` and returns.

    - If the `listingId` matches the `Id` of the found listing, it constructs a new `activeListingsWithFilteredMedia` object:

        - It checks if the listing has more than one media item (`currentActiveListing?.Media?.length > 1`). If so, it includes media items from index 1 to 5 in the new object, effectively filtering the media.

        - It includes other properties like `isLiked`, `description`, and `roomsTotal` from the detailed listing data and the found listing.

    - Finally, it sets the `activeListing` using the `setActiveListing` function with the constructed `activeListingsWithFilteredMedia` object.

### Example Usage
```jsx static
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import useHandleDetailedListingItem from './useHandleDetailedListingItem';

function DetailedListing({ listingId, allListings, favoriteListingsIds }) {
  const [activeListing, setActiveListing] = useState(null);

  useHandleDetailedListingItem({
    listingId,
    allListings,
    favoriteListingsIds,
    setActiveListing,
  });

  // Render the active detailed listing
  return (
    <div>
      {activeListing ? (
        <div>
          <h2>{activeListing.title}</h2>
          <p>{activeListing.description}</p>
          {/* Render other details */}
        </div>
      ) : (
        <div>No active listing selected.</div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default DetailedListing;
```

In this example, the `useHandleDetailedListingItem` hook is used within a React component to manage and display the active detailed listing, considering the provided parameters and detailed listing data fetched using `useGetDetailedListing`.
