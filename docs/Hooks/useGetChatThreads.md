The `useGetChatThreads` custom hook is designed for fetching and managing chat threads data from a Firebase Realtime Database. This hook is intended to be used in a React application and provides functionality for loading initial chat threads and subscribing to real-time updates.

### Usage
```jsx static
import useGetChatThreads from './useGetChatThreads';

// Inside a functional component
useGetChatThreads({
  chatThreads,
  setChatThreads,
  setChatThreadsIsLoading,
  UID,
  depsList,
});
```

### Parameters
- `chatThreads` (Array): An array representing the current chat threads that you want to update.
- `setChatThreads` (Function): A function used to update the chat threads.
- `setChatThreadsIsLoading` (Function): A function used to set the loading state of chat threads.
- `UID` (String): A unique identifier, typically representing a user, to retrieve their chat threads.
- `depsList` (Array): A dependency array, which specifies the dependencies for when the effect should run. This is typically used to control when the hook should fetch and update chat threads.

### Return Value
This custom hook doesn't return any value directly. Instead, it internally manages the state of chat threads and their loading status through the provided functions (`setChatThreads` and `setChatThreadsIsLoading`).

### Functionality
1. **Importing Dependencies**: The hook begins by importing the necessary dependencies such as `useEffect` for side effects, `ChatAPI` for initial chat thread data fetching, and Firebase Realtime Database functions (`off`, `onValue`, `ref`, `db`) for subscribing to real-time updates.

2. **Defining the Custom Hook**: The `useGetChatThreads` function is defined, which takes several parameters to set up and manage chat thread data.

3. **Initial Chat Threads Loading**: The hook checks if the `chatThreads` array is empty. If it is, it fetches initial chat threads using the `ChatAPI.getChats` function, passing the user's `UID`. This is typically done only once when the component mounts.

4. **Real-time Updates Subscription**: It sets up a Firebase Realtime Database reference to the chat threads specific to the user's `UID`. It defines an `onDataChange` function that is called whenever the data at the reference location changes. Inside this function, it updates the `chatThreads` state with the latest chat threads data obtained from the snapshot.

5. **Cleanup**: The hook returns a cleanup function that unsubscribes from real-time updates by calling `off` on the reference when the component unmounts.

6. **Effect Dependency**: The effect is run whenever any of the dependencies in the `depsList` array change. This allows you to control when the hook fetches and updates chat threads based on changes in the provided dependencies.

### Example Usage
```jsx static
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import useGetChatThreads from './useGetChatThreads';

function ChatComponent() {
  const [chatThreads, setChatThreads] = useState([]);
  const [chatThreadsIsLoading, setChatThreadsIsLoading] = useState(true);
  const UID = 'user123'; // Replace with the actual user's UID

  // Provide dependencies to control when the effect should run
  const depsList = [UID];

  useGetChatThreads({
    chatThreads,
    setChatThreads,
    setChatThreadsIsLoading,
    UID,
    depsList,
  });

  // Render chat threads and loading state
  return (
    <div>
      {chatThreadsIsLoading ? (
        <div>Loading chat threads...</div>
      ) : (
        <ul>
          {chatThreads.map((thread) => (
            <li key={thread.id}>{thread.title}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default ChatComponent;
```

In this example, the `useGetChatThreads` hook is used to manage chat threads data within a React component, and it handles both initial data loading and real-time updates from Firebase Realtime Database.
