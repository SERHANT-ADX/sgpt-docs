The `ProfilePageProvider` component is a React context provider that manages the state and logic related to a user's
profile page. It encapsulates various pieces of functionality and data that are used within the `ProfilePage` component,
making them available to all the child components of `ProfilePage`. The component utilizes hooks, statics, and effects
to achieve its functionality.

### Statics:

- `user` and `UID`: These static variables are extracted from the `useAuthorization ` hook provider to get the current
  user's information
  and unique identifier (`UID`).

### Hooks:

- `screenSize` and `isMobile`: These hooks utilize the `useScreenSize` custom hook to determine the screen size and
  whether the user is on a mobile device.

- `navigate`: This hook is used to programmatically navigate the user to different routes within the application.

- `useParams`: This hook retrieves parameters from the URL route.

- `useState`: Several state variables are managed using this hook,
  including `chatThreads`, `chatThreadsIsLoading`, `presets`, `presetsIsLoading`, `generatedImages`, `generatedImagesIsLoading`, `favoriteListings`,
  and `activeListing`.

- `useFavoriteListings`: This custom hook is used to fetch the user's favorite listings based on their `UID`.

- Other custom hooks such
  as `useHandleDetailedListingItem`, `useGetImagesPresets`, `useGetChatThreads`, `useGetAllListings`,
  and `useGetGeneratedImages` are used to manage specific aspects of the profile page.

### Effects:

#### `useEffect` for Managing Favorite Listings

```jsx static
useEffect(() => {
    const favoriteListings = allListings?.filter((listing) => (favoriteListingsIds || []).includes(listing.Id));
    setFavoriteListings(favoriteListings || []);
}, [allListings, UID, favoriteListingsIds]);
```

**Purpose:** This effect is responsible for updating the `favoriteListings` state, which contains a list of listings
that the user has marked as favorites. It filters `allListings` based on the `favoriteListingsIds` array, which stores
the unique IDs of the user's favorite listings. The filtered list is then set as the new value of `favoriteListings`.

**Dependencies:**

- `allListings`: An array of all available listings.
- `UID`: The unique identifier of the user.
- `favoriteListingsIds`: An array of unique IDs representing the user's favorite listings.

### Handlers:

- `handleApplyFilter`: This handler is called when a filter is applied. It sets the initial saved filter and navigates
  the user to the editing page.

- `handleToggleLikePreset`: This handler is used to toggle the "like" status of an editing preset.

- `handleToggleLikeGeneratedImage`: This handler is used to toggle the "like" status of a generated image.

- `handleToggleLikeListingItem`: This handler is used to toggle the "like" status of a favorite listing.

### Context Value:

The `contextValue` is a combination of the various state variables, handlers, and other relevant data mentioned above.
It provides these values to child components through the `ProfilePageContext.Provider`.

### Custom Hook:

- `useProfilePage`: This custom hook allows other components to easily access the context values provided by
  the `ProfilePageProvider`. It throws an error if used outside the scope of the provider.

### Usage:

1. The component fetches and manages data related to chat threads, presets, generated images, and favorite listings.
2. It handles the navigation between different pages, like applying filters and toggling "like" status.
3. It encapsulates the above logic and makes it available to its child components using the React context API.

Overall, the `ProfilePageProvider` is a complex component that centralizes the state management and logic related to a
user's profile page, making it easier to maintain and provide a consistent experience across different parts of the
application.
