The `EditingPhotosPreview` component is responsible for rendering the preview of generated images and handling
navigation between them.

### Props

- **setItemForEditing (`function`):** A function to set the currently selected item for editing.
- **generatedItemsList (`array`):** A list of generated image URLs.
- **isItemGenerated (`boolean`):** Indicates whether images have been generated.
- **getImageToShow (`function`):** A function that returns the URL of the currently selected image.
- **isMobile (`boolean`):** Indicates whether the current device is mobile.
- **itemForEditing (`string`):** The URL of the currently selected item for editing.

### Usage Example

```jsx static
import EditingPhotosPreview from './EditingPhotosPreview'; // Import the component

const EditingPhotosPage = () => {
	// ... other code ...

	return (
		<div>
			{/* ... other components ... */}
			<EditingPhotosPreview
				setItemForEditing={setItemForEditing}
				generatedItemsList={generatedItemsList}
				isItemGenerated={isItemGenerated}
				getImageToShow={getImageToShow}
				isMobile={isMobile}
				itemForEditing={itemForEditing}
			/>
		</div>
	);
};
```

### Component Structure

The `EditingPhotosPreview` component is structured as follows:

- **Conditional Rendering (`if`, `else if`, `else`):** Renders different content based on different conditions:
  - If `generatedItemsList` exists and `isItemGenerated` is true:
    - Renders a preview image slider.
  - If `generatedItemsList` is missing and `isItemGenerated` is true:
    - Renders a single preview image.
  - If none of the above conditions are met:
    - Renders a placeholder content.
  - Each rendering condition includes JSX with relevant elements and logic.

### Hooks Used

- **useScreenSize (`function`):** A hook that provides information about the current screen size.

### Functionality

- The component handles navigation between generated images using the previous and next arrow buttons.
- If `generatedItemsList` exists and `isItemGenerated` is true, the component displays a preview image slider that
  allows navigation through generated images.
- If `generatedItemsList` is missing and `isItemGenerated` is true, the component displays a single preview image.
- If none of the above conditions are met, the component displays a placeholder content.
- For mobile devices (`isMobile`), the generated images are displayed using a slider for better user experience.
- For larger screens, the generated images are displayed in a grid.

### Memoization

- The component uses the `useMemo` hook to calculate the active item index based on the selected item for editing and
  the generated items list.
