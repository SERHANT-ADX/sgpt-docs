The `ProfileListingOutletProvider` component is a React functional component designed to act as an intermediary between
the routing logic and the `ProfileListingItem` component. Its primary purpose is to obtain specific props from the
routing context provided by the `react-router-dom` library's `<Outlet />` component and pass them to
the `ProfileListingItem` component. This allows the `ProfileListingItem` component to receive context-specific data and
functions needed for rendering a real estate listing within a user's profile.

### Props

The `ProfileListingOutletProvider` component does not accept any props directly. Instead, it relies on the props
obtained from the routing context, which include the following:

- **setActiveListing:** A function to set the active listing within the profile page. This function is typically used to
  update the currently displayed listing when the user navigates between different listings in their profile.

- **listing:** An object representing the details of the real estate listing to be displayed. This object includes
  information such as the listing's images, price, and description.

- **isMobile:** A boolean value indicating whether the user is accessing the profile page on a mobile device. This
  information can be useful for responsive rendering within the `ProfileListingItem` component.

- **handleToggleLikeListingItem:** A function for toggling the "like" status of the listing. When called, this function
  updates the like status of the listing, allowing the user to add or remove it from their favorites.

### Component Structure

The `ProfileListingOutletProvider` component has a simple structure:

- It uses the `useOutletContext` hook from `react-router-dom` to access the routing context provided by the
  parent `<Outlet />` component.

- It extracts the required props (`setActiveListing`, `listing`, `isMobile`, and `handleToggleLikeListingItem`) from the
  routing context.

- It renders the `ProfileListingItem` component and passes these extracted props to it.

### Usage

To use the `ProfileListingOutletProvider` component, follow these steps:

1. Import the `ProfileListingOutletProvider` component into your application.

   ```jsx static
   import ProfileListingOutletProvider from './ProfileListingOutletProvider';
   ```

2. Place the `ProfileListingOutletProvider` component within your routing configuration where you want to render real
   estate listings within the user's profile.

   ```jsx static
   <Route
		path="profile/"
		element={<ProfilePageProviderLazy />}
	>
       <Route
           path="listing/:id"
           element={<ProfileListingOutletProvider />}
       >
   </ Route>
   ```

3. Ensure that the parent `<Outlet />` component is configured in your routing structure, as it is responsible for
   providing the necessary context to `ProfileListingOutletProvider`.

4. The `ProfileListingOutletProvider` component will receive context-specific props from the routing logic and pass them
   to the `ProfileListingItem` component.

By using the `ProfileListingOutletProvider` component, you can keep your routing logic clean and focused on navigating
between different listings within the user's profile while providing the required data and functions to
the `ProfileListingItem` component for rendering specific listing details. This separation of concerns enhances code
organization and maintainability.
